# BGC-val-public toolkit

## Introduction

Originally designed as a toolkit for investigating the time development of the marine biogeochemistry component of the UK Earth system model,
BGC-val has since expanded to become a generic tool for comparing model data against historic data. 

The toolkit is python 2.7 based, and is freely available, and distributed with the BSD 3 clause license, via our in-house gitlab server. 
Registration is required, via this link: http://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Access_Code


The goal was to make the evaluation framework as generic as possible:
* Model independent.
* Grid independent.
* Coordinate independent. 
* Dataset independent.
* Field independent.
* Simple to use.


This package utilises:
* python parallelization. 
* Front-loading analysis function
* Regular save points + shelve files.
* Versioning in git (using gitlab)
* Web visible html summary reports.

Please cite this package as:
 ```
 This information will be provided once the paper is published.
 ```

# Requirements

To use this package, the following python packages are required:
* matplotlib
* netCDF4
* numpy 
* scipy
* cartopy 

Please note that cartopy can be difficult to install, as it has a few requirements: 
such as geos, geos-python, geos-devel, proj4, cython etcâ€¦ (http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/)
Fortunately, it is already available on several UK computational systems, such as JASMIN or ARCHER.

If they are not available on your linux system, most of these python packages can be installed with the command:

```bash
pip install --user packagename
```

In addition, the netcdf manipulation toolkit is also required:
* netcdf_manip  - This package is available on the gitlab server. https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/ledm/netcdf_manip

Access to this packages can be requested via the web form: http://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Access_Code






# Installation

Once the required packages have been installed, make a local clone of the trunk of this package with the command:
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk:ledm/bgc-val-public.git
```

Note that the package name here is subject to change, and that you should check the path at the top of this page.

In the local copy, use the following pip command to make a local installation of this package:

```bash
pip install -e . --user
```

If the pip software management system is unavailable, 
then these packages can be added to the $PYTHONPATH in your shell
run configuration filoe (ie, bashrc, zshrc or cshrc).
This command  is shell specific but in bashrc it will look like:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/bgc-val-public
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/netcdf_manip
```



# Running

Once the package has been installed, please look at the file of ini files and locate one that is 
most compatible with your goals and computing system. 
Our example below uses the cmip5_jasmin.ini configuration file,
which directs the evaluation several CMIP5 models on the JASMIN data processing facility.

Before running the suite, please make a copy of your choosen ini file.
Make sure that you go through your copied configuration file, and check that the
paths to data, evaluations requested reflect your coputational environment,
data paths, and goal of your analyses. 

The default cmip5_jasmin.ini file has all the included analyses switched on in the [Active Keys section](#Active_Keys),
you may want to turn most of these off, at least while setting up the evaluation suite.

Many of the paths in the [Global Section](#Global_Section) will also need to be changes to reflect your local environment.


The command to run this evaluation is:
```bash
./run.py ini/cmip5_jasmin.ini
```
where the run.py script is the main script that runs the analysis, and the ini file is
a configuration script that contains all information, flags, paths and settings
needed to produce an analysis.



These three directories will hold:
* workingdir: Post processed files for each of the analyses.
* images: The .png image files that are produced.
* reports: the html report which can be viewed using a web browser.

`run.py` is a simple wrapper which calls the script, [analysis_parser.py](#Analysis_Parser), 
and passes it the path to the [config ureation .ini file](#Run_Config_Initialisation_File) file.



## Analysis Parser

`analysis_parser.py` is a script which parsers the configuration file, 
and then sends the relevant flags, paths, filenames
and settings to each of the main analyses packages. 
The configuration file is described below and in the paper. 
The analysis packages called are:
* Time Series (TS): This looks at a series of consequtive model files and produces various time series analysis.
* Profile Plots: This produces plots showing the time development of the depth-profile of the model.
* Point to point: This produces a point to point comparison analysis of the model versus data for a single year, including statistical analysis, spatial mapping etc.
* Report Maker: This takes all the plots produced and summarises them in an html document.

The location of the model and data files, the description of the files, the regions, times, depth layers under investgation
are all set in the runconfig.ini file. 



## Run configuration initialisation file

The `runconfig.ini` file contains all information, flags, paths and settings needed to produce the analysis.

Note that config files use the following convention:
```ini
[Section]
option : value
; comment
```

When loading the config file into python's module `ConfigParser`, beware that:
* Sections hold capitalisation
* Options all become lowercase
* Values are parsed as strings
* End of line comments require a space or tab before the ';'


The parser expects an [Active Keys](#Active_Keys) section, a section for each key in `[ActiveKeys]`
and a [Global Section](#Global_Section).


The `runconfig.ini` file is parsed by the [bgcvaltools/analysis_parser.py](./bgcvaltools/analysis_parser.py) tool.



## Active Keys

The `[ActiveKeys]` section contains the boolean switches that activate the analysis sections described elsewhere in the `runconfig.ini` file.
The order of the active keys here determines the order that the analysis runs and also the order each field appears in the final html report.
Keys are switched on by being set to `True` and are switched off by being set to `False` or being commented out with a leading ';'.

Each live key in the `[ActiveKeys]` section requires another section with the same name in `runconfig.ini`. ie:
```ini
[ActiveKeys]        
Chlorophyll         : True

[Chlorophyll]
; Chlorophyll analysis details:
...

```


## An exmaple of a active Keys section in runconfig.ini

The following is an example of the options  needed to produce a typical 2D analysis.
In this case, this is a comparison of the surface chlorophyll in MEDUSA against the CCI satellite chlorophyll product.

```ini
[Chl_CCI]
name            : Chl_CCI               ; The name of the analysis.
units           : mg C/m^3              ; The final units, after any transformation function has been applied.
datasource      : CCI                   ; The name of the data source

regions         : Global                ; The regional cuts to make.
```

Note that:
* Many of these fields can be defined in the `[Global]` section, and ommited here, as long as they are the same between all the analyses.
  For instance, the model calendar, defined in `model_cal` is unlikely to differ between analyses. 
  More details below in the [Global Section](#Global_Section_of_the_runconfig.ini) section.
  
* The operations in the `data_convert` and `model_convert` options can be any of the operations in `bgc-val-public/stdfunctions.py`
  or they can be taken from a localfuntion in the localfunction directory. More details below in the [Functions](#Functions) section.

* Layers can be selected from a specific list of named layers or transects such as `Surface`, `Equator`, etc..
  Arbitrary Layers or Transects can also be defined in the config.ini:
    * Any integer will load that depth layer from the file.
    * Any number followed by 'm', (ie 500m) will load that depth.
    * Any transect along a latitude or longitude can be defines. ie (60S, or 28W)


* Regions here is a portmanteau for any selection of data based on it's coordinates, or data values.
  Typically, these are spatial regional cuts, such as `NorthernHemisphere`, but the regional cut is not limited to spatial regions.
  For instance, the "January" "region" removes all data which are not in the first month of the year.
  In addition, it is straightforward to add a custom region if the defaults are not suitable for your analysis.
  More details area availalbe in the [Regions](#Regions) section, below.


## Global Section

The `[Global]` section of the `runconfig.ini` file contains the global flags and the default settings for each field.
For instance, the model calendar, defined in `model_cal` is unlikely to differ between analyses, so it can safely
be set as a default value the `[Global]` section and ommited elsewhere. 

The Global options `jobID`, `year`, `model` and  `scenario` can be singular values.
For instance, if the evaluation only needs to run over one model, year, jobID, or scenario.
However, any of these options can be set to multiple fields in by instead using the options: `jobIDs`, `years`, `models` and  `scenarios`.
For instance, if the evaluation needs to compare multiple models, years, jobs or scenarios.

In addition, the values defined in the `[Global]` for `jobID`, `year`, `model` and  `scenario`
can be used to define specific paths at runtime. 
For instance, paths using `$JOBID`, `$YEAR` or `$MODEL`.
Similarly, `$NAME` can be used as a stand in for the name option for of each analysis. 

Some values can not be set in the `[Global]`, for instance the `name`, and `model_vars`
and `model_convert` fields are by definition unique for each analysis.


The following is a typical `[Global]` section:
```ini
[Global]
jobID             : u-am927              ; Unique run/simulation/job identifier
years             : 1980 1990            ; Year to look at for p2p.
model             : MEDUSA               ; model name
scenario	  : historical		 ; scenario

## Functions

The `data_convert` and `model_convert` options in the analysis section of the `runconfig.ini` file are used 
to give apply a python function to the data as it is loaded. 

Typically, this is a quick way to convert the model or data so that they use the same units.
With this is mind, most of the standard functions are basic convertions such as 
* multiply by 100.
* Divide by 1000
* Add multple fields together
* Or simply do nothing, just load one field as is.


However, more complex functions can also be applied, for instance:
* Depth integtation
* Global Total sum
* Flux through a certain cross section.



The operations in the `data_convert` and `model_convert` options can be any of the operations in `bgc-val-public/stdfunctions.py`.
They can be also taken from a localfuntion in the localfunction directory. More details below in the [Functions](#Functions) section.

These functions take the netcdf as a dataset object. 
The dataset class defined in bgcvaltools/dataset.py and based on netCDF4.Dataset with added functionaility. 



## Layers

Layers can be selected from a specific list of named layers or transects such as `Surface`, `Equator`, etc..

Any arbitrary depth layer or transects along a constant lattitude or congitude can also be defined in the `runconfig.ini` file:
* Any integer will load that depth layer from the file.
* Any number followed by 'm', (ie `500m`) will calucate the layer of that depth, then extract that layer. 
* Any transect along a latitude or longitude can be defines. ie (60S, or 28W). This works for both 1 and 2 dimensional coordinate systems.




## Regions

The `regions/` directory contains tools that are used to mask out unwanted regions in the data.
For instance, these tools can be used to:
* Remove negative values.
* Remove zero values
* Remove data outside a certain depth range.
* Remove data outside a latituge or longitude range. 

The function produces a mask to hides all points that are not in the requested region.

The list of regions requested is set in the `runconfig.ini` `regions` option, both in the `[Global]` section
and for each field.


The full list of "Standard masks" is defined in the file `regions/makeMask.py`, 
but it is straightforward to add a custom region using the template file, `regions/customMaskTemplate.py`.
Simply make a copy of this file in the regions folder, rename the function to your mask name,
and add whatever cuts you require.

Each regional masking function has access to the following fields:
* name: The name of the data. (useful for debugging)
* region: The name of the regional cut (or slice)
* xt: A one-dimensional array of the dataset times.
* xz: A one-dimensional array of the dataset depths.
* xy: A one-dimensional array of the dataset latitudes.
* xx: A one-dimensional array of the dataset longitudes.
* xd: A one-dimensional array of the data.


It is possible stack masks, simply by adding the masks together. 
For instance, the masking function here excludes all
data outside the equatorial region and below 200m depth.

```python
from regions.makeMask import Shallow, Equator10
def ShallowEquator(name,newSlice, xt,xz,xy,xx,xd,debug=False):
	newmask = np.ma.array(xd).mask
	newmask += Shallow(name,newSlice, xt,xz,xy,xx,xd)
	newmask += Equator10(name,newSlice, xt,xz,xy,xx,xd)	
 	return newmask	
```

However, more complex masking is also possible, for instance in the file `regions/maskOnShelf.py`
which loads a bathymetry file and masks all points in water columns shallower than 500m.


Please note that:
* The name of the function needs to match the region in your `runconfig.ini` file.
* Note that xt,xz,xy,xx,xd should all be the same shape and size. 
* These cuts are applied to both the model and the data files.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
## Longnames

This is a folder which contains dictionaries in .ini format.

These are the pretty public-facing long names for all the python objects, strings and other fields used in the bgc-val.

The index (or key or option) of the .ini file is the name of the field in the code, and the 
value (or item ) in  the dictionairy is the long name, which is used in plots, tables and html. 

For instance:
```ini
[LongNames]
n_mn                                 : Mean Nitrate
sossheig                             : Sea Surface Height
lat                                  : Latitude
```

The dictionaries are loaded at runtime by `longnames/longnames.py`. This script loads all .ini files in the `longnames/` directory.
Users can easilly add their own dictionairies here, without disturbing the main longname.ini dictionairy.

The longname for a specific field is called with:
```python
from longnames.longnames import getLongName
string = 'CHL'
ln = getLongName(string)
```
Note that if a longname is not provided, the string is returned unchanged. 



# The analysis packages

In this section of the `README.md` we look at the programming decisions that were made 
in the design process of the BGC-val suite.


## Time Series (TS)

This looks at a series of consequtive model files and produces various time series analysis.
The files needed to run this are hosted in the `timeseries` directory.
The idea behind the time series tool is to try to understand the model data one time step at 
a time, then produce visualisations that clearly show the time development of the model.

The main time series script is `timeseriesAnalysis.py` in the `timeseries` directory.
The script checks to see whether the model and observatioal data are present. 
Then it loads the observational data (if present) and then the model data.
Both the model and observatioal data are loaded with the DataLoader tool in the 
`timeseriesTools.py` file in the `timeseries` directory.
This process creates a python dictionairy where the processed data is indexed according to :
`(region, layer, metric)`.
The processed model data is stored as another dictionary. 
The second layer dictionairy uses the model's calendar year (converted into a float) as
the index, and the value is the processed model data associated with that time and `(region, layer, metric)`.
This nested dictionary object is called modeldataD in the `timeseriesAnalysis.py`.
Each modeldataD is stored in a shelve file.

This double nested dictionary may seem confusing, but it safer than parrallel 
arrays used elsewhere. For instance, an example of loading this file from shelve would be:
`modeldataD['Global','Surface','Mean'][1955.5]`
would produce the Global surface mean of the year 1955. 

The modeldataD are stored as shelves and are openned by several of the plotting tools, but can also be opened manually in the command line.

The times series produces plots using the `timeseriesPlots.py` file in the `timeseries` directory..
This file contains several python functions which use matplotlib to create visualisations 
of the time series and profile data.
The simple times series, the traffic lights plots, the multitimeseries,
map plots, hovmoeller plots, and profile plots are all produced by functions in this file.
 
The time series directory also includes the `timeseriesTools.py` script.
This toolkit contains several functions used by the other files in the time series folder. 

The time series directory also includes the `extentMaps.py` and `extentProfiles.py` scripts,
which allow users to make maps showing the extent of the data that sits above or below a certain threshold.

The time series directory also includes the `analysis_level0.py` tool which is used to produce an
html summary table of the final years of a simulation. 


## Profile Plots

This produces plots showing the time development of the depth-profile of the model.
The files needed to run this are hosted in the the `timeseries` directory.

The profile tools use many of the same processes and tools as the time series analyses,
however instead of running them over one layer, it runs them over many layers in succession.


## Comparison plots

This tool produces plots showing the time development comparing several models/scenarios/jobs 
of the model. The files needed to run this are hosted in the  `comparisonAnalysis.py` scrinpt in the
`timeseries` directory.






## Point to point
This produces a point to point comparison analysis of the model versus data for a single year, including statistical analysis, spatial mapping etc.
The files needed to run this are hosted in the the `p2p` directory.



MORE DETAILS NEEDED





## Report Maker

This takes all the plots produced and summarises them in an html document.
The files needed to run this are hosted in the the `html` directory.

The `html` folder contains several templates, some python tools and lots of html assets (css, fonts, js, sass, images).

The html report was based on a template provided by html5up.net under the CCA 3.0 license.

The primary python tool used to produve html reports from a configuration file is the
`makeReportConfig.py` file. 
This includes a function that loads the configuration file, then figures out what was requested,
a pushes this all into a self contained html site.
The html folder can be copied into a web facing server, or opened directly using firefox.

The location of the report on disk is determined by the global flag.
